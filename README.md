## Thanks for stopping by!

The **Data Science Working Group’s** purpose is to efficiently assess, inspire, and tackle [Code for San Francisco’s](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org) data science needs, as well as to help the City with its data science needs whenever appropriate. Our practicing and aspiring data scientists are available to:  

+ develop data science-centric solutions to social good problems;
+ assess/inspire the possibility of data science components in other projects;
+ provide resources to help produce those components;
+ provide a learning environment for ourselves and others to learn more practical data science.

In pursuing the above, we humbly hope that CfSF's dedicated project groups come to consider us an integral and synergistic resource for the brigade at large.
